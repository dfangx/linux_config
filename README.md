# My Linux Configuration Files
## Description
This is a central repository for all my Linux configuration files and scripts. 
## Installation
1. Clone the repository. For **HTTPS**, use `git clone
   https://www.github.com/dfangx/linux_config.git`. For **SSH** (recommended),
   use `git clone git@github.com:dfangx/linux_config.git`. Use `git clone
   --recurse-submodules` for vim plugins and Firefox css.

   directories in the repository to your $HOME. You may choose to modify this if
   you wish.
